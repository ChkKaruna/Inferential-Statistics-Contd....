Example 1.Calculate Expected Value for the problem below
          The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are
          108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
          Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?
        
Solution: Total weight: 108 + 110 + 123 + 134 + 135 + 145 + 167 + 187 + 199 = 1308
          Total no. of values/ outcomes = 9
          Assume one patient is chosen at random =1/9
          Expected Value = ∑X/n= 1308 /9 = 145.33333 ≈ 145
          
Example 2.Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child:
          Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
          i. Child A – probability of having 1 candy is 0.015
          ii. Child B – probability of having 4 candies is 0.20

            CHILD             Candies count         Probability
              A                     1                  0.015
              B                     4                  0.20
              C                     3                  0.65
              D                     5                  0.005
              E                     6                  0.01
              F                     2                  0.12

Solution: Expected number of candies for the randomly selected child
          =(1*0.015) + (4*0.20) + (3*0.65) + (5*0.005) + (6*0.01) + (2*0.120) =3.225
          
          
Example 3.Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range & comment about the values / draw inferences, for the given dataset
          For Points, Score, Weigh
          Find Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range and comment about the values/ Draw some inferences.
Solution: Please refer code file 'Inferential Statistics_Example-3'
           Parameters	         Points	        Score	    Weigh
            Mean	              3.59	        3.21	    17.85
            Median	            3.69	        3.33	    17.71
            Mode	              3.07, 3.92	  3.44	    17.02, 18.90
            Variance	          0.28	        0.93	     3.19
            Standard Deviation	0.53	        0.96	     1.77
            Range	              2.17	        3.83	      8.39

          Inferences :
            Points data is positively skewed, however the Score & Weigh data are negatively skewed.
            Points & Weigh are bimodal.
            Variance of Point column is very low indicating that data is clustered together around the mean as  compared to the Weigh data, data points are far from mean. The spread of Score data points is also less.
            Also, range of these attributes confirms the same spread pattern as indicated by variance.


Example 4. Look at the data given below. Plot the data, find the outliers and find out  μ,σ,σ^2
           Hint: [Use a plot which shows the data distribution, skewness along with the outliers; also use Python code to evaluate measures of centrality and spread]
